# RabiModel
Static and dynamical properties of states in the Quantum Rabi Model and variations

clone as:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/djuliannader/RabiModel.git
```

For stationary states, manipulate parameters from input.dat and run as:

```bash
julia main.jl
```

For the survival amplitude of quench dynamics, manipulate parameters from main_dqpts.jl and run as :

```bash
julia main_dqpts.jl
```

For the survival amplitude of quench dynamics, with initial thermal state, manipulate parameters from main_dqpts.jl and run as :

```bash
julia main_dqpts_thermal.jl
```
